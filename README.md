# Historia Żarówki
## What is my project
This website project was created at the request of my web development course. I had to program, from start to finish, a simple webpage with some basic SCC and JavaScript.

## Functions
After you read all the information based on Wikipedia, you can play with the light toggle above the bulb image.
## Conventions used
The entire site has been coded using BEM
